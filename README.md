# Progessive Battery Discharge Assembly
Self:


This collection of artifacts presents a response to a project design challenge designed to replicate the manual progressive discharge of a battery of single round smallarms fire in a manner of the original design of Dr. Gatlin.  The intent is to stay within the Federal Firearm regulations by employing only manual power to cycle the individual guns within the battery.


Intended Use:
Wild pig/boar/sow hunting from a game stand about 100 yards from a timed feeder at a hunting ranch  in West Texas.  These creatures are extremely destructive.  There is no game license or restriction to removing these unwanted varmints from the environment.  


Parameters of the Challenge:
1> Only manual power may be  employed to rotate, to control the progressive, sequential discharge in individual guns within the battery.
2> Modern mechanical components may replace any mechanical component of the original Gatlin Gun as patented.
3> Design changes and design evolution that improve upon the original design are encouraged.



Early Design Decisions:
1> The caliber of the guns was set to be 45ACP due to availability of the ammunition and of known quality modern components.
1.1> Sufficient quantities of 45ACP ammunition is on-hand to support substantial testing.
1.2> A set of HK USC 45 components is available to begin physical measurement of the barrel, bolt, bolt housing, trigger, sear, hammer, magazine, magazine feed, and cycling/action.
2> The number of guns in the demonstration battery was set to be two.  Two guns is sufficient to verify the feasibility of the design. and project.
3> Where possible the design will carry forward expandability from the demonstration quantity of two guns to four , six, and eight guns as practical.




Status:
211211: The demonstration design has matured to the point where a CAD model assembly of the Gun Battery exists.   It is now time to begin securing the mechanical components to close several design points that await physical testing.


Extendability:
As created the demonstration model can be retro-designed using the CAD artifacts to accommodate different calibers.  The barrels, bolts, feeding and firing mechanism would require re-engineering.
