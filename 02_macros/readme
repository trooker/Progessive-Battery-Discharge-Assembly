Macros that provide annimation.

CrankFire.macro:  Fires a full magazine at speed.
CrankFireSingleStep: Singles steps through the Fire Cycle to allow user to reach a specific cycle position.
Crank2Zero: Allows user to single step to the Zero position.

These macros and their associated icons should be installed in the appropriate annimation workbench (suggested A2Plus) 
to support the desired annimation.  See the sub-folder for the process steps to install the macros and icons in the
workbench toolbar.
